Tasks based on the TODO document:


## 1. **Current UI/UX & Responsiveness Issues**

### Home Page
- **Image Issue on Mobile:** The portrait image is cut off or disappears on smaller screens due to `display: none` in media queries.
- **Text Alignment:** On mobile, text and image overlap or stack awkwardly.
- **Lack of Animation:** Only basic scroll reveal; no hero animation, parallax, or interactive elements.
- **Social Icons:** Could be larger, animated, or have tooltips.

### Skills Page
- **Skills Tags:** Good, but could be more visually dynamic (hover, pop, or animated in).
- **Section Spacing:** On mobile, tags can overflow or become cramped.
- **No Filtering/Grouping:** Could allow filtering by skill type or animated grouping.

### Projects Page
- **Cards:** Good structure, but could use hover effects, animated entry, and clickable overlays.
- **Mobile Layout:** Cards stack, but spacing and padding could be improved.
- **No Project Modal:** Clicking a project could open a modal with more info/screenshots.
- **No Project Filtering:** Could add filtering by tech/area.

### Footer
- **Simple:** Could add animated icons, a “back to top” button, or a mini contact form.

**Let me know your preferences for About, project modals, and any extra sections. Once you confirm, I’ll start implementing these upgrades step by step for a world-class, modern, and mobile-friendly portfolio!**

---

Perfect! Here’s the plan based on your feedback and best practices for a world-class, modern, and mobile-friendly portfolio:

---

## 1. **About Me Section**
- **Approach:** Add a dedicated “About Me” section (not a separate page, but a prominent section after the hero).
- **Content:** Highlight your current company (Viamagus) and key skills/achievements:
  - Intelligent document processing with Vision LLMs
  - Multi-agent AI systems (task delegation, sub-agents, MCPs)
  - Agentic memory, RAG, RAGAS, fine-tuning (UnslothAI)
  - Contract analysis, open-source LLM deployment, technical demos
- **Style:** Use icons, subtle animation, and a timeline or “highlight cards” for achievements.

---

## 2. **Experience Page**
- **Approach:** Since you have one main company, integrate “Experience” as a section within “About Me” (timeline or card style). If you add more jobs later, it can become a full page.

---

## 3. **Project Details Modal**
- **Approach:** Use a modal popup for project details (with images, tech stack, and links). 
- **Mobile:** The modal will be fully responsive—on mobile, it will slide up from the bottom, be scrollable, and have a clear close button.

---

## 4. **Blog/Articles Section**
- **Approach:** Add a “Blog” or “Articles” page/section.
- **Content:** Start with 2 articles based on your `TECH_NOTES.md` (Jinja2 Templating, and a combined “Frameworks & LLM Integration” article).
- **Style:** Card-based, animated entry, with a modal or dedicated article page for each.

---

## 5. **Color Palette & Theming**
- **Palette:** Use your provided palette:
  - #264653 (Deep Blue-Green)
  - #2A9D8F (Turquoise)
  - #E9C46A (Pastel Yellow)
  - #F4A261 (Pastel Orange)
  - #E76F51 (Coral)
- **Config:** Centralize colors in CSS variables for easy palette swaps.
- **Dark Mode:** Carefully tune for contrast and vibrancy in both modes.

---

## 6. **Other Upgrades**
- **Animations:** Animate hero text, skill tags, project cards, and section reveals.
- **Image Handling:** Home image will be circular, always visible, and perfectly centered/scaled on all screens.
- **Accessibility:** Add alt text, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.
- **Footer:** Add animated icons, back-to-top, and a mini contact form.
- **Responsiveness:** Every section will be tested and tuned for all device sizes.

---

## 7. **Next Steps**
1. Refactor color palette and theme config.
2. Add About Me section with experience highlights.
3. Upgrade home image and hero animation.
4. Animate and improve skills section.
5. Add project modal with mobile support.
6. Add blog/articles section with 2 articles.
7. Polish footer and add contact form.
8. Test and tune for mobile, accessibility, and dark mode.
