# Technical Architecture
- HTML5, CSS3 (with CSS variables for palette), JavaScript (vanilla, with ScrollReveal, Swiper, etc.)
- Responsive grid/flex layouts for all sections
- Modal system for project/blog details (mobile-friendly)
- Blog/article content as markdown or HTML in codebase
- Color palette config in :root and .dark-mode CSS
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA, alt text

# Development Roadmap
- Phase 1: Color palette refactor, theme config, and dark mode polish
- Phase 2: Home/hero section upgrade (animation, image, social)
- Phase 3: About Me/Experience section (timeline/cards, icons)
- Phase 4: Skills section (animated tags, filter, proficiency bars)
- Phase 5: Projects section (animated cards, modal, filtering)
- Phase 6: Blog/articles section (2 articles, modal/page)
- Phase 7: Footer/contact, accessibility, polish, and QA

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Start with palette/theme config (foundation for all styling)
- Upgrade home/hero (first impression)
- Add About/Experience (context)
- Enhance skills (showcase expertise)
- Build projects (showcase work)
- Add blog/articles (thought leadership)
- Footer/contact and polish last

# Risks and Mitigations
- Mobile image scaling: use CSS aspect-ratio, object-fit, and media queries
- Modal on mobile: test for scroll, close, and accessibility
- Animation performance: use lightweight libraries and limit excessive effects
- Color contrast: test all palette combos in both modes

# Appendix
- Resume.txt for experience/skills
- TECH_NOTES.md for blog/article content
- Palette: #264653, #2A9D8F, #E9C46A, #F4A261, #E76F51
