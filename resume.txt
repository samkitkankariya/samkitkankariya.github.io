WORK EXPERIENCE
Python & Generative AI Engineer (Viamagus, Bengaluru - Remote)​ ​
​
​
​
July. 2024 – Present
▪​ Led the development of an intelligent document processing system integrating Vision LLMs within an agentic framework;
achieved 2x accuracy improvements over traditional OCR by employing context-aware analysis, iterative data validation,
and human-in-the-loop integration, reducing turnaround times by 80%.
▪​ Architected and built a scalable production level multi-agent AI system, incorporating task delegation (sub-agents), diverse
tool utilization (MCPs), and persistent agentic memory, enabling autonomous execution of complex workflows.
▪​ Significantly improved AI workflow: Restructured the intent classification system, leading to a 50% increase in chatbot
accuracy and a 15% reduction in response times.
▪​ Fine-tuned Vision LLM model using UnslothAI, achieving 20% accuracy improvement through advanced training
techniques.
▪​ Developed robust RAG Evaluation Framework: Implemented RAGAS and other metrics, resulting in a 30% increase in
retrieval efficiency and improved model performance.
▪​ Engineered a contract analysis feature with automated comment generation, reducing manual legal review time by 20%.
▪​ Deployed open-source LLM models (Hugging Face) on local servers with FastAPI, implementing efficient inference pipelines.
▪​ Effectively communicated technical capabilities and business value to clients through technical demos.
▪​ Conducted in-depth R&D on 7+ advanced Complex RAG models to select the optimal architecture for the agentic framework.
▪​ Contributed to team expansion by conducting 8 technical interviews for Gen AI specific roles.
